      My expereince with this homework has been fun and practicle. Servers and librarys such as node have always scared me.
      From my little knowledge of computer science or coding jobs creating servers is a huge part of it. Personally I love
      creating the games and little pages so i can send themt ot friends and family. But the amount you can do with servers
      and the functionality of them is very intimidating but also amazing. I never thought I would get to the point where I wasnt
      terrified creating or learning about servers. These past two weeks have been difficult because I destroyed my new macbooks screen
      with a kadama so ive been using my olf mac. And man if I ever stay in this field I would be getting red of all apple products
    . Had to figure out how to run terminal for the videos to understand and see if it was working. Lots of technical difficulties.

    Node.js fits into so much we have done this semester and feels like almost what we have been doing has lead up to this. 
    The fact that I got through all the videos and reading without being overwhelmed or terribly confused says a lot. Still dont fully
    understand servers and node its all very intricite and has so many layers and different ways to acheive the same thing. All in all though
    node.js could have been used in a lot of our homework and accomplished things with less steps.
